# Multiple Disease Checker Application

Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly useful for doctors, nurses, radiologists, 
researchers, pharmacists, emergency medical service, and many other healthcare rofessionals. This paper proposes the creation of a smart healthcare system using artificial intelligence as a means of efficiently solving challenges in the healthcare industry and as a tool for optimizing patient care plans. The proposed AI-assisted system shows that it can support a patient who is admitted to the hospital through emergency medical services, easily process the patientâ€™s data, and offer early detection of serious diseases.
